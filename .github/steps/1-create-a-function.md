## Step 1: Write a function

_Time to code! :computer:_

**What is a function?**:

Generally speaking, a `function` is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal, in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function as parameters, and the function can return a value.

1. [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) on your computer.
2. Checkout to a new branch called `my-functions`.
3. Locate the `myFunctions.js` file. This is our working area.
4. Create the body of the functions listed in the file without changing the name of the functions.
5. Once you are ready, `push` your changes to your remote branch `git push origin my-functions`
6. We will run some tests so, do not remove the `export` keyword before the functions! You will learn about this very very soon!
